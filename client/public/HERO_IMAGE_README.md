Place your hero image in the client/public folder with the filename `hero.jpg`.

Recommended:
- Filename: hero.jpg
- Suggested size: 1600x900 or 1400x700 (use high-resolution for clear display on large screens)
- Format: JPEG or PNG

After adding the file, refresh the dev server. The hero will use the image at `/hero.jpg`. If the file is missing, the hero falls back to the gradient background.
